"""Check two invariants of the vector-search cache (the regression gate for the 2026-09-11 performance fix).

Background: `project_search` and `project_notes` each have a layer of embedding cache, and both
invariants are implicit contracts that "look right and, when broken, only become slower or staler",
which are very easy to break unintentionally during a refactor:

  A. The symbol cache key must cover all input fields of the embedding
     - `symbols.id` is renumbered entirely by a full rescan (clearAll → DELETE + reinsert), so
       using id as the key invalidates the whole cache after every rescan (once caused a single
       vector search to recompute for 349s)
     - if the key misses an input field, a change to that field does not trigger a recompute →
       a stale vector is returned

  B. The note cache must be able to detect changes to deep files
     - it once used the "project root directory mtime" to decide invalidation, but that only changes
       when a direct child is added or removed → changing an existing deep file was judged
       "unchanged", returning stale search results

Usage (run from the project root):
    PYTHONPATH=Sources/MCPScripts \\
    FASTEMBED_CACHE_PATH=~/.cache/utility/fastembed \\
    ~/.config/utility/mcp-venv/bin/python3 scripts/check-search-cache-invariants.py

Exit code 0 = all passed; 1 = an invariant was broken. It only uses a temp directory and does not
touch real data.
