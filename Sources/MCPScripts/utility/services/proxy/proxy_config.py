#: The response compression encoding whitelist **declared by ourselves** when forwarding to
#: the upstream (not passing through the client's Accept-Encoding).
#:
#: The upstream picks the compression method by this header — measured on deepseek: declare
#: zstd and it returns zstd, declare br and it returns br, and it **compresses even a 200 SSE
#: stream**, not just error responses. Yet this proxy must read and rewrite the response body
#: (SSE usage extraction, model-name injection, skill dedup, output filtering), so being
#: unable to decode means discarding the whole response **along with the upstream's real
#: status code**: when aiohttp's decoder is unavailable it raises `ContentEncodingError`
#: (inheriting `PayloadEncodingError` → `BadHttpMessage`, **code always 400**), which in
#: `ClientResponse.start()` is wrapped into `ClientResponseError(status=400, message='Can not
#: decode content-encoding: …')` and turned into a 502 by the except below — the `400` in the
#: error text is **not the upstream status code**; the client only sees an unexplained 502 and
#: retries repeatedly (the 2026-10-12 user report had exactly this shape).
#:
#: Only declare encodings aiohttp can actually decode in this venv: gzip/deflate go through
#: the stdlib zlib, br needs Brotli, zstd needs backports.zstd (aiohttp 3.14 only then
#: supports zstd, and only installs it via the speedups extra) — both are installed and
#: written into requirements.txt. Contract group 7 asserts "every declared encoding is
#: decodable by this process", so **writing one in on a machine without the library turns it
#: red** (that is exactly what it is meant to catch: declaring an undecodable encoding
#: amounts to discarding the whole response together with the real status code). Install the
#: library before adding a new encoding.
