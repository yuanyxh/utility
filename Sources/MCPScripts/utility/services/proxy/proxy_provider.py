"""Field contract for model proxy provider configuration.

The providers list is serialized by Swift `TokenProxyManager.providersJSON()`
and passed in via the `MODEL_PROXY_PROVIDERS` environment variable;
`token_proxy.py` reads it to decide which upstream to forward to.

This module is the **single parsing entry point** for these fields: when the
field names are written in two places, a rename on the Swift side silently
makes both sides fall back to defaults — the protocol conversion direction
goes wrong and the auth key is lost, with nothing visible in the logs. Now
that it is centralized here, such drift needs only one place changed, and
validation and warnings can be added here.
