    Semantics: the fraction of characters in new_content that are matched
    character-for-character by an existing section, directly measuring the amount of new
    information -- coverage approaching 1 -> the generated section is basically a
    restatement of existing sections -> judged no addition and skipped.
    ratio is disturbed by length differences (long sections dilute, short sections
    inflate), while coverage distinguishes "rewrite-style duplication" better (measured:
    ScanTextUtil duplicate coverage 0.767 vs typical increment 0.595).
    Sections are split on multi-level headings (#{1,6}) rather than H1 only: for a file
    organized with multi-level headings (##/###), splitting by H1 degrades into one
    whole-file section, diluting similarity with unrelated content (2026-08-07 root-cause fix).

    duplication, directly restating relevant facts -> duplicate sections (2026-08-07
