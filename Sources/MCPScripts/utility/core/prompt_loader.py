"""Unified entry point for Python-side prompts: built-in defaults + user overrides + declarative contract.

Prompts used to be hard-coded across 10 functions/constants (f-strings or long constants),
which had three consequences: changing a single prompt sentence required digging through the
source; the user is not necessarily a Chinese speaker; and a mistake neither raised an error nor
fell back. This module collapses "get a prompt" into one thing.

Directories and priority (for the same feature, only the highest-priority file is used):

    <config-dir>/prompts/<feature>.md              user override, highest priority, **language-independent**
    <MCPScripts>/prompts/<lang>/<feature>.md       built-in default, shipped with the package (.copy preserves the dir tree)

The language dimension of the two locations is **intentionally different**: built-in templates
target "users who may speak different native languages", so they are split into language dirs and
fall back to the baseline when a language is missing; a user override is a single file that **the
user controls**——the person writing the prompt has only one native language, so making "which
directory it goes in" depend on the UI language is both meaningless and would break when the
language is switched.

The config dir reuses the **existing** env contract: the `UTILITY_DATA_DIR` injected by Swift is
`~/.config/utility` (`AppPaths.configDir`), so no new env item is added.

The language comes from `UTILITY_LANG` (Swift sets it from `general.language`, empty falls back to
the system primary); the default is `zh-Hans`; when the language has no such file it **falls back
to the `zh-Hans` baseline** and logs a warning——a not-yet-translated feature should not stall the
feature, but it must not be silent either (otherwise "the translation didn't take effect" would be
impossible to discover).

Declarative contract (front-matter, flat keys, no YAML dependency):

    ---
    name: aggregate
    placeholders: [label, facts_text]
    json_keys: []
    ---

- `name` must match the feature name: a misplaced file (e.g. writing a.md's content into b.md)
  is exposed immediately, instead of silently using the wrong prompt.
- `placeholders` must match the placeholders actually appearing in the body (file self-check);
  at call time the arguments must cover the declaration (missing → raise `PromptLoadError`,
  otherwise `{topic}` would be sent to the model verbatim); extra arguments only log a warning.
- `json_keys` are the **keys expected in the model output**, for post-call validation
  (`missing_json_keys`); empty = not declared.

Rendering does **not use `str.format`**: prompts contain many JSON braces (`{"action": "merge"}`),
and format would treat them as placeholders. Instead it uses "one-shot replacement by name"——
unregistered `{...}` are kept verbatim, and substituted values are not replaced a second time
(otherwise a value containing `{x}` would be clobbered by a later replacement).
This is the same pattern as Swift `PromptManager.applyVariables`.

Failure-handling chain during load: an invalid user override file → error log + **keep looking for
the built-in default** (a user's mistake should not stall the feature); the built-in default is also
unreadable → raise `PromptLoadError` (a corrupt install is a development-time error; silently
passing an empty prompt to the model is worse than failing outright).
